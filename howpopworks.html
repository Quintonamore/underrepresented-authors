          Thank you again for choosing to use our extension! The point of our chrome extension is to recommend our users books about/written by under-represented groups in the publishing industry. To do this, our extension pays attention to when our users are looking for books on websites. If the extension sees that the user is looking at books, a popup will appear and recommend books from our database accordingly. That's the gist of it! Please enjoy!
